## 2.1 Wireless PS2 Controller

### 2.1.1 Getting Started

The wireless receiver for the controller is pre-installed in the robot at the time of shipment. To power the controller, insert two AAA batteries into the battery compartment on the back of the controller.

### 2.1.2 Device Connection

Step 1: Turn on the Spiderbot using the power switch.

Step 2: Turn on the controller. The red and green LED indicators on the controller will begin flashing simultaneously.

Step 3: Wait a few seconds. The robot and controller will automatically pair. Once pairing is successful, the green LED will remain solid.

Step 4: If the connection fails, turn off both the robot and the controller. Then repeat the steps above.

Sleep Mode: If the controller is not connected to the robot within 30 seconds after being powered on, or if there is no user input for 5 minutes after connection, the controller will enter sleep mode. To wake the controller, simply press the “START” button.
